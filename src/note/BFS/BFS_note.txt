word Ladder 126
the important point is that we construct the undirected map in the process of BFS, because we have known the begin and the end node, and
  //if current word can mutate into end word, we are done, ladder is found, it is shortest because of BSF
            if(mutations.contains(end))
            {
                foundLadders.add(node);
                shortestPathLevel = node.level;
                // when find one solution, we stop continuing to scan the next level
                continue;
            }
