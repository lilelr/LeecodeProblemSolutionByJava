如 MinimumPathSum64
 * Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
 // Making progress depends only two move. Moving down or moving right.
   resGrid[i][j] = Math.min(resGrid[i - 1][j], resGrid[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j];
 然后引入最大最小值,求解
